  "body": "# shinyGEO\r\nshinyGEO is a web-based tool that allows a user to download the expression and sample data from a [Gene Expression Omnibus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/browse/) dataset, select a gene of interest, and perform a survival or differential expression analysis using the available data. For both analyses, shinyGEO produces publication-ready graphics and generates R code ensuring that all analyses are reproducible. The tool is developed using shiny, a web application framework for R, a language for statistical computing and graphics.\r\n\r\n## Webpages\r\n\r\nPrimary Application Hosting at Eastern Connecticut State University: http://bioinformatics.easternct.edu/shinyGEO/\r\n\r\nPrimary Homepage: http://gdancik.github.io/shinyGEO/\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nShinyapps.io (Mirror site): https://jasminedumas.shinyapps.io/shinyGEO\r\n\r\nShinyapps.io (Mirror site): https://gdancik.shinyapps.io/shinyGEO/\r\n\r\nGitHub Repo Page: http://github.com/jasdumas/shinyGEO/\r\n\r\nGithub Homepage: http://jasdumas.github.io/shinyGEO/\r\n\r\n## Running shinyGEO locally \r\n\r\n1. Download and install *R* from https://cran.r-project.org. (Note: *shinyGEO* requires *R*>=3.23)\r\n\r\n2. Open *R*. Then type the following (you may copy and paste) into the *R* console in order to install the CRAN packages required by *shinyGEO*:\r\n\r\n\t`install.packages(c(\"shiny\",\"survival\",\"shinyBS\",\"GGally\",\"ggplot2\",\"shinyAce\",\"knitr\",\"rmarkdown\",\"RCurl\",\"shinyjs\",\"shinydashboard\"))` \r\n\r\n        `install.packages('devtools')`\r\n        `devtools::install_github('rstudio/DT', ref = \"f3e86a6\")`\r\n\r\n3. Type the following to install the Bioconductor Packages required by *shinyGEO*:\r\n\r\n\t`source(\"http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R\")`\t\t\r\n\t`biocLite(c(\"Biobase\",\"GEOquery\"))`\r\n\r\n4. Type the following to run *shinyGEO*:\r\n\r\n\t`library(shiny)`\t \r\n\t`runUrl(\"https://github.com/gdancik/shinyGEO/archive/master.zip\")`\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\nMain contributors: Jasmine Dumas, Michael Gargano, Garrett M.
