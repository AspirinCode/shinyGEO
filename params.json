{"name":"shinyGEO","tagline":"A web application to perform differential expression and survival analysis on microarray gene expression data sets","body":"# shinyGEO\r\nshinyGEO (Project Name: GEO-AWS / Gene Expression Omnibus Analysis with Shiny) is a web application to parse, transform, model, and visualize microarray gene expression data sets from the [Gene Expression Omnibus Repository](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/browse/) and performs differential expression and survival analyses. This project is currently in **development** as part of the [2015 Google Summer of Code program](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015). The current (post-GSoC version) development version as of 21 August 2015 19:00 UTC to the present can be found [here](https://github.com/jasdumas/GEO-AWS) as per the program code submission guidlines.\r\n\r\n## Website\r\nhttps://jasminedumas.shinyapps.io/shinyGEO\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n1. Fork a copy!\r\n\r\n2. Clone to your desktop\r\n\r\n3. if you don't have these packages already, put the following into your [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) console: \r\n`install.packages(c(\"shiny\", \"reshape2\", \"survival\", \"shinyBS\", \"GGally\", \"ggplot2\", \"shinyAce\", \"knitr\"))`\r\n\r\n4.  Bioconductor package are downloaded differently. Place the following into the console:\r\n  `source(\"http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R\")`                                                                       \r\n    `biocLite(c(\"GEOquery\", \"Biobase\", \"affy\", \"limma\"))`\r\n  \r\n5. This project depends on some development versions of pacakge(s): \r\n`devtools::install_github('rstudio/DT')`\r\n\r\n6. In the console `library(shiny)` then `runApp(\"shinyGEO\")`\r\n\r\n7. Feel free to test out the tool functionality by entering the GEO Accession number: [GSE19915](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE19915) which includes survival characterstics to generate Kaplan-Meier curves under the Analyses tab menu.\r\n\r\n8. `library(devtools)`\r\n\r\n  `devtools::install_github(\"jasdumas/shinyGEO\")`\r\n\r\n  `library(shinyGEO)`\r\n\r\n  `runGitHub(\"shinyGEO\", \"jasdumas\")`\r\n  \r\n9. `runUrl('https://github.com/jasdumas/shinyGEO/archive/master.zip')`\r\n\r\n## Find out more\r\n_Feel free to check out the project [wiki](https://github.com/jasdumas/GEO-AWS/wiki)_\r\n\r\n## Updates\r\n* 11 SEPTEMBER 2015: This GitHub Repo and corresponding links have be updated to a \r\nnew name to conform with CRAN naming conventions and for deployment guidelines\r\n\r\n* 2 OCTOBER 2015: The application has been deployed to shinyapps.io cloud service at https://jasminedumas.shinyapps.io/shinyGEO Report bugs, glitches, and general comments as this is the first release designated for testing and configuration. \r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\nThis project is in beta/demonstration only mode and is scheduled to be launched in early Fall 2015. A considerable amount of the features are functional but if you discover a bug or non-working application features with certain data sets, please feel free to submit an [issue](https://github.com/jasdumas/GEO-AWS/issues) or contact the pacakge maintainer.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nJasmine Dumas [@jasdumas](https://twitter.com/jasdumas)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
