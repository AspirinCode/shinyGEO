{"name":"shinyGEO","tagline":"a web application for analyzing Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets using shiny","body":"# shinyGEO\r\nshinyGEO is a web-based tool that allows a user to download the expression and sample data from a [Gene Expression Omnibus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/browse/) dataset, select a gene of interest, and perform a survival or differential expression analysis using the available data. For both analyses, shinyGEO produces publication-ready graphics and generates R code ensuring that all analyses are reproducible. The tool is developed using shiny, a web application framework for R, a language for statistical computing and graphics.\r\n\r\n## Webpages\r\nShinyapps.io: https://jasminedumas.shinyapps.io/shinyGEO\r\n\r\nGitHub Repo Page: http://jasdumas.github.io/shinyGEO/\r\n\r\nGithub Homepage: http://jasdumas.github.io/shinyGEO/\r\n\r\nEastern CT Primary App Hosting: http://bioinformatics.easternct.edu/shinyGEO/\r\n\r\n## Running shinyGEO locally \r\n1.
